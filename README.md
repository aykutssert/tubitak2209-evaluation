# Project Proposal Evaluation and Analysis System

An AI-powered web platform for automated evaluation of T√úBƒ∞TAK 2209-A project proposals using Natural Language Processing, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and modern web technologies.

## üéØ Project Overview

This system revolutionizes the project proposal evaluation process by combining advanced AI technologies to provide automated, consistent, and objective assessment of research proposals. Developed as a graduation thesis project, it addresses the challenges of manual evaluation through intelligent document analysis and contextual question-answering capabilities.

### Key Features
- **Automated Evaluation**: AI-driven assessment using predefined rubrics with detailed scoring
- **RAG-based Q&A**: Intelligent question-answering system with Turkish BERT embeddings
- **Document Processing**: Advanced DOCX parsing with hierarchical content extraction
- **Real-time Analysis**: Instant feedback and comprehensive evaluation reports
- **User Management**: Firebase authentication with evaluation history tracking

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture
